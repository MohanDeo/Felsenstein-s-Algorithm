# Felsenstein's-Algorithm
This programme can calculate branch lengths of a tree given node values. It also calculates the likelihood of a tree with given mutations, where each node in the tree represents an individual with or without a mutation.

The attached `question_sheet.pdf` provides more information about this problem. The file `tree_data.txt` contains the supplementary data needed to solve this problem.
